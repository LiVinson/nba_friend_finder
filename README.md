# NBA Friend Finder

The NBA Friend Finder application is full-stack sitethat allows users to complete a 10 question survey to find out which NBA superstar they are most like. Once the survey is complete, the name and a gif from the GIPHY API of the user's match is displayed in a modal. 

NBA Friend Finder is deployed at Heroku: [Friend Finder](https://sheltered-citadel-34944.herokuapp.com/)

## Design Details

* The front end uses Bootstrap 3.3.6 with images dynamically displayed.

* All html pages are displayed using express to handle routing

* Once a user submits a response from 1 to 5 to the 10 survey questions, the data is captured and a match is sent in response to a POST request.
